=====amtrak ridership by state
http://www.narprail.org/uploads/3/0/4/0/30401991/states.pdf
Only ten metropolitan areas are responsible for almost two-thirds of Amtrak
ridership.
Amtrak ridership grew by 55 percent since 1997, faster than other major travel
modes, and now carries over 31 million riders annually, an all-time high
The short-distance routes consistently dominate Amtrak ridership share and captured
nearly all of Amtrak’s recent growth
Combined, Amtrak’s short-distance corridors generated a positive operating balance
in 2011—while corridors over 400 miles returned a negative operating balance
